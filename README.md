Grocery at the palm of your hands
## What is Grocer?
Grocer is an application to check the availability of a particular item in the local shops near you. With the help of grocer you can just make a request through our app which will let you know if the particular items is in stock or not.
## How does it work?
In our application once you enter you will be greeted by a login screen, after logging in the application will ask you if you are a shop owner or a consumer. 
1. In-case of a shop owner it will ask you to add items from the given list and their respective quantities and once you are done it will fetch that to the back-end i.e. firebase.
2. If youâ€™re a user you will be taken to main page from where you can select from which store you want to buy and then after adding the items to you basket you can make a request to back-end to check the availability.
